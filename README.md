# Understanding NFL Football

## Class Description

- **Object** - This class is meant for adults and others who don't already know
a lot about American football and the NFL.
- **Purpose** - Learn the basics of American football and important aspects of the NFL,
including the teams, the league calendar, the business, and its impact on the larger culture
("learn about dumb Americans without becoming one").
- **Content** - Follow NFL teams throughout the sports season while learning the basics
of American football, including terminology, scoring, offense, defense, special teams,
passing plays, running plays, turnovers, how to win games and the championship, injuries,
and behavior (both on and off the field). Additional emphasis will be given to the home team,
the Philadelphia Eagles, with review of its history, culture, and in-season performance.
Other topics like how teams acquire talent, key non-athlete personnel, and other incarnations
of American football both nationally and internationally will also be reviewed.
- **Method** - Key content areas will be organized into their own units (like running plays)
and be covered by in-class lectures. Significant class time will also be spent reviewing video,
including game highlights. One or more optional unofficial class events, neither financed by
nor the responsibility of the school, may also be held depending on class interest -
including visiting a (classy) sports bar and possibly playing two-hand touch.
- **Length** - One semester, from September to around early February before the Super Bowl
